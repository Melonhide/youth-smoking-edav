# Introduction


There are three main questions we are interested in pursuing:

- What are the most common reasons that young people start using
tobacco/e-cigarettes and how prevalent is tobacco/e-cigarette usage in young
people?
- Is there a demographic difference (i.e. race, educational level) between
tobacco/e-cigarettes usage in young people? Or some other social factor
difference?
- Based on usage and adoption trends, should there be more strict policies to
prevent or deter young people from tobacco/e-cigarette usage?
